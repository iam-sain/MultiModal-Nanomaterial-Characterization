# MultiModal-Nanomaterial-Characterization
Nanomaterials characterization has historically utilized highresolution imaging methods, such as Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), to obtain information on the structural and morphological characteristics of nanomaterials. SEM and TEM are limited in their ability to provide useful contextual information about the nanomaterial being characterized. Relevant contextual information can include details about the synthesis of the material, as well as the precise chemical composition and other annotations regarding the material’s potential use. Characterizing nanomaterials using a single imaging modality limits the ability to accurately classify and understand nanomaterial morphology and composition, and therefore develop accurate methods for synthesizing nanomaterials. The multimodal nanomaterial characterization system proposed will provide an alternative approach to overcome the above limitations by combining the structural and morphological information from the images, with the contextual information. Hence, the multimodal characterization system has the potential to provide a scalable method for automating the analysis of nanomaterials for quality control, high-throughput screening and material discovery
